## Build Your Own Router: CSC 525 Computer Networking Project
Functional IP router that is able to route real traffic.

## Overview
In this project, we're tasked with building our very own IP router capable of routing real-world traffic. We began with a basic router template, and our mission is to incorporate functionalities like ARP, IP forwarding, and ICMP ping. The router should be able to manage traffic for diverse IP applications, including web-based file transfers.
